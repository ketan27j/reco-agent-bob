## How It Works

The recommendation engine uses a hybrid approach combining:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Analyzes bottle characteristics (spirit type, proof, price)
   - Computes similarity between bottles using cosine similarity
   - Considers user's existing collection patterns

2. **Diversity-Based Recommendations**:
   - Identifies gaps in user's collection
   - Suggests popular bottles from unexplored spirit categories
   - Maintains price range consistency

3. **Price Range Analysis**:
   - Adapts recommendations to user's spending patterns
   - Applies flexible price tolerance
   - Ensures suggestions remain within reasonable price bounds

## Output Format

The recommendation output includes:

1. Personalized bottle recommendations with:
   - Ranking
   - Bottle name and spirit type
   - Price
   - Recommendation reason

2. User statistics:
   - Collection size
   - Average bottle price
   - Spirit types in collection
   - Collection diversity score
